Repository with developments for Bachelor's thesis : **Experience-based Image Description Generation**

Developed by: Rubén Gómez Blanco, Adrián Pérez Peinador y Adrián Sanjuán Espejo.

Note: This repository only includes samples of the images used for the different processes. In order to be able to execute most notebooks, you have to download case base images and test images.
## Direcotry structure
### dataset
Samples of the dataset and notebooks used to download and analyze it. Large files are referenced in txt files.

## image_recuperation
A study of different similarity metrics between images divided in three types:
  - Pixel level similarities:
    - image_sim_pix.ipynb
    - image_pix_utils.py
  - Object based simillarities
    - image_sim_tag.ipynb
    - image_tag_utils.py
  - Embeddings based similarities
    - image_sim_emb.ipynb
    - image_emb_utils.py
    - embeddings_analyzer.ipynb

## question_recuperation
Processes to recover questions from most similar images.

## recuperation_evaluation
Answer processing and analysis of user test done to evaluate best similarity metric for question retrieval.

## coco_caption_evaluation
Complete process of description generation using gthe best retrieval technique and incorporating a VQA systesm and a text generation model. This directory also contains an evaluation of the descriptions generated using different metrics.

## description_evaluation
Answer processing and analysis of user test done to evaluate descriptions generated by our proporsal.
